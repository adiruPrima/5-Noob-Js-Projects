# Todo List

This is a simple web application that allows users to add, delete, and persist tasks in a todo list.

## Features

- Add new tasks to the list.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Persist tasks in local storage to retain them across sessions.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the app's functionality.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Type a task into the input field and press Enter to add it to the list.
3. Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
4. The tasks are saved in local storage, so they will persist across browser sessions.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: The structure of the app with an input field for tasks and a list to display the tasks.
- **CSS**: Styles the task input field, the task list, and the buttons.
- **JavaScript**: Contains the functionality to add, delete, and persist tasks using local storage.
