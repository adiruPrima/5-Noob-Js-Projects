# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application that checks if a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same backward as forward.

## Features

- Input a word to check if it is a palindrome.
- Displays a message indicating whether the word is a palindrome or not.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the app's functionality.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a word into the input field.
3. Click the button to check if the word is a palindrome.
4. A message will be displayed indicating whether the word is a palindrome or not.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: The structure of the app with an input field and a button to check the palindrome.
- **CSS**: Styles the input field, button, and result message.
- **JavaScript**: Contains functions to check if the word is a palindrome and display the result.
