# Random Quote Generator

This is a simple web application that generates and displays a random quote from a predefined list of quotes.

## Features

- Generates a random quote from a list of quotes.
- Ensures each quote is displayed only once until all quotes have been displayed.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the app's functionality.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the button to generate a random quote.
3. A random quote will be displayed each time you click the button until all quotes have been displayed, after which the cycle will reset.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: The structure of the app with a quote display area and a button to generate a new quote.
- **CSS**: Styles the quote display area and the button.
- **JavaScript**: Contains the list of quotes and the functionality to generate and display a random quote.
