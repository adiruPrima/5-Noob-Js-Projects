# Color Picker App

This is a simple Color Picker web application where users can choose a color or get a random color. The background of the page changes to the selected color.

## Features

- Pick from predefined colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow.
- Choose a random color.
- Interactive buttons to change the background color.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the app's functionality.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click on any of the color buttons to change the background color of the page.
3. Click on the "Random" button to set a random background color.

## How It Works

- **HTML**: The structure of the app with buttons for each color and a "Random" button.
- **CSS**: Styles the buttons and the overall layout of the app.
- **JavaScript**: Contains functions to change the background color based on button clicks.
